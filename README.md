# Netrecon 

>Tool to scan the network you're connected to.

Netrecon is a **bash script** that automates the process of scanning a network and finding the key targets. It was built to save time when carrying out any kind of recon in a network. 

This script is designed to be the first task to run when connecting to a network. It will provide you with the active hosts in the net and will search for some of the most important ports on them; also, it will provide you with screenshots of the web servers detected in the net; all of this while maintaining the anonymity.

## Getting Started
